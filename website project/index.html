            The D1E1 was a short discussion on the first day of the IXD1 class, which included individual presentations of the students' projects to highlight their interest areas. I talked broadly about two of my projects, one being my first semester Performance of Understanding project, which was a magazine (Libert√©) which was based on feminism. The concept of making something like a published document was very interesting, which captivated me to pursue my interest in typography, posters and visual elements. Other than that, the other works were my posters, which is something I casually experiment with in my free time.
